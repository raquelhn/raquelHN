# PORTFOLIO
## OVERVIEW

A portfolio/resume website developed by myself using vanilla javascript, html and css. It includes the following sections:

*About me, where I expand on my journey and my desicion to study computer science.
*Projects, where you can find some of my personal projects.
*Blog, where you can find posts about programming topics like objected oriented programming, among others.

I took inspiration from Awwwards and CodePen.
